            <h1>My Fav Basketball Player: Kyrie Irving.</h1>
            <h1>PLAYER NEWS</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h2><strong>Kyrie Irving said he's completely recovered from the right shoulder procedure that ended his 2019-20 campaign after just 20 games.</strong></h2>
            <p>Irving's 2019-20 campaign was nothing short of disastrous in terms of games played, but he did look good in his limited floor time and will obviously be looking to bounce back in a major way next year as the Nets go on an official title chase with a healthy Kevin Durant. Irving is too risky to take in the first round on draft day, but if he's able to stay healthy, there's a good chance he'll return first-round value. </p>

            <h2><strong>Kyrie Irving (right shoulder) will not travel with the Nets to Orlando.</strong></h2>
            <p>The Nets are also leaving behind Kevin Durant (right Achilles), allowing them to presumably have access to team facilities for their rehab. Both guys have long been ruled out of playing in the 'bubble' anyway, so this comes as no surprise.</p>

            <h2><strong>Multiple players and reporters have refuted that Kyrie Irving suggested players "start their own league" in a group chat with teammates.</strong></h2>
            <p>Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News reported, "Kyrie Irving has proposed to his teammates they should start their own league, and itâ€™s not necessarily in response to the bubble situation." That report drew immediate fire from Irving's teammates Chris Chiozza, Theo Pinson and Caris LeVert, with Pinson writing, "This is FAKE news! Just stop!" Irving has expressed concern about joining the NBA's re-start in Orlando, but the idea that players would form a new league is very far-fetched.</p>
